# React Native Authentication Workshop

The aim of this repository is to gather, with educational purposes, the step by step implementation
for a complete authentication workflow in a React Native App.

## How to use it

There are two alternatives.

### npm & Expo

This project uses Expo to develop React Native applications for Android and IOS, check its [installation] guidelines to use it with your computer. Once everything is prepared you can just type the following commands on the project's root folder:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

And scan the QR code using the [Expo Go] app with your phone, it will build the app and start it on your phone for testing. You could also use an Android or IOS simulator with your computer, please check the Expo documentation to find out how to do it.

### Docker

If you don't want to install everything on your machine, and you are familiar with Docker, you can just use the [Dockerfile] that it is provided in the project to build a development docker image and launch it running:

```bash
    ./scripts/init-development-container.sh
```

This script will launch the Expo project in a Docker container and if you are in the same wifi net you can use the [Expo Go] app with your phone. But you won't be able to use Android or IOS simulators.
